Delta Tau PMAC
==============

Notation: "$" denotes hexadecimal number.

Configuring PMAC
----------------

- Set the "VMEbus Address Modifier" (I90):
	- $39 for A24 addressing (default).
	- $9 for A32 addressing.
- Enable both "supervisory" and "non-privileged" VMEbus data access by setting
	the "VMEbus Address Modifier Don't Care Bits" (I91) to $4 (default).
- For A32 addressing only, set the "VME Base Address Bits A31-A24" (I92) to the
	most significant hex nibble; e.g. for $A123 0000 set I92 to $A1.  The
	default value ($FF) is N/A.
- Leave the "VME Mailbox Address Bits A23-A16" (I93) at the default value
	($7F) so it does not conflict with the DPRAM.
- Leave the "VME Mailbox Address Bits A15-A08" (I94) at the default value
	($A0) so it does not conflict with the DPRAM.
- Set 


- Set the "VME DPRAM Base Address Bits A23-A20" (I97); for example,
	- for A32 addressing, at base address $A123 0000 set I97 to $23.
	- for A24 addressing, at base address $00D0 0000 set I97 to $D0.
	The default value is $0.

- Set the "VME DPRAM Enable" (I98) to $E0 to enable DPRAM access; the default
	value is $60.
- Set the "VME Address Width Control" (I99) to:
	- $90 for A24 addressing.
	- $80 for A32 addressing.
	The default value is $30.


- Enable DPRAM ASCII communication; set I58 to 1.
